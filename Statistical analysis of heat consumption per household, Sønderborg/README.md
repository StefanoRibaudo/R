## Statistical analysis of heat consumption per household, SÃ¸nderborg

Part of a larger analysis, this code shows examples of what I did for this project.\
Initially the data is read and presented for preliminary inspection. Then the analysis focuses on the heat consumption during winter. The code will show a boxplot with information about the four houses.\
We are then asked to demonstrate the assumption of normal distribution for the heat consumption of a house. Although this isn't true for the whole year, it is true for small periods of time such as a couple of months. This is shown with q-q plots.\
We'll then compute confidence intervals for the mean of heat consumption for the houses and study for which the means differ significantly.\
Lastly we'll focus on covariance and correlation between heat consumption and variables such as global radiation.
