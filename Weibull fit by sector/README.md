## Weibull fit by sectors

The objective is to fit a Weibull distribution to the measured data. This is firstly done on the whole measurement campaign.\
Each wind measurement is then sorted into 12 sectors based on the direction of the incoming wind.
The sectors span 30° each, the central values are 0°, 30°, ... , 300°, 330° where North is 0° and East is 90°.\
New Weibull distributions are fitted to each sector. The results are plotted to show how direction influences the wind speed distribution for this site.
